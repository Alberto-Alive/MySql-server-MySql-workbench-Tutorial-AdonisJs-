#MySql SERVER --VS-- MySql WORKBENCH

MySql server provides your DBMS (database management system) with querying and connectivity capabilities. Translated: Create a server for your database, create an account (or more accounts) for this database so you can query this database via MySql Workbench.
MySql workbench is a visual database design tool. Translated: Create a connection to an MySql server account (or more accounts), create a schema (database interface) for that account (or more accounts), migrate your database schema from adonisjs, query and display the data.
To sum up: MySql server is providing the back end while MySql workbench is providing the front end. Your job is to link the two so to be used as one.
